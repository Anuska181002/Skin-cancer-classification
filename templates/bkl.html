    <h1>BENIGN KERATOSIS-LIKE LESIONS DETECTED</h1>
  </header>

  <main>
    <p>
        Benign keratosis-like lesions are non-cancerous skin growths that resemble actinic keratoses in appearance but lack the potential to progress to invasive skin cancer. They are primarily a result of chronic sun exposure and are typically harmless. Two common examples of these lesions are seborrheic keratoses and solar lentigines (age spots or sunspots).
        Seborrheic keratoses: Raised, waxy, or crusty growths with a stuck-on appearance, ranging in color from light tan to dark brown or black.
        Solar lentigines: Flat, tan to dark brown spots resulting from localized hyperpigmentation due to sun exposure.

      <p>
        Benign keratosis-like lesions usually do not require specific treatment since they are harmless and non-cancerous. However, if these growths cause discomfort or are cosmetically bothersome, they can be removed through various methods, including:
<ul>
    <li>Cryotherapy: Freezing the lesions with liquid nitrogen.</li>
    <li> Curettage: Scraping off the lesions with a curette.</li>
    <li>Electrodessication: Cauterizing the lesions with an electric current.</li>
</ul>
It is essential to consult a healthcare professional before deciding on any treatment, as some lesions may not be suitable for removal based on their location or other factors.

      <h2 style="color:#3d09f6 ; font-family:verdana;">Diagnostic</h2>
      <p>
        Benign keratosis-like lesions are typically diagnosed through visual examination by a dermatologist or other healthcare professionals experienced in skin conditions. In most cases, the appearance and location of the lesions are sufficient to make a diagnosis. If there is any doubt about the nature of the lesions, a skin biopsy may be performed to confirm that they are benign and non-cancerous.

        A skin biopsy involves removing a small sample of the lesion for microscopic examination by a pathologist. The examination helps differentiate benign keratosis-like lesions from potentially precancerous or cancerous growths.
        </p>
      <p>
        As with any skin changes or concerns, it is crucial to seek medical evaluation for proper diagnosis and management. Regular skin examinations and sun protection measures are essential to prevent the development of both benign and precancerous skin conditions related to sun exposure.
