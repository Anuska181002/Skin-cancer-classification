    <h1>ACTINIC KERATOSES AND INTRAEPITHELIAL CARCINOMAS DETECTED</h1>
  </header>

  <main>
    <p>
        Actinic keratoses and intraepithelial carcinomas are both types of skin lesions that arise due to chronic exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, primarily from the sun. They share some similarities but have distinct characteristics and potential for progression to more serious skin conditions.

      <h2 style="color:#3d09f6; font-family:verdana;">Basic Treatement</h2>
      <p>
        Treatment for both actinic keratoses and intraepithelial carcinomas usually involves:
<ul>
    <li>Topical medications: Creams or gels containing ingredients such as 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), imiquimod, diclofenac, or ingenol mebutate can be applied to the affected areas to help remove or destroy the abnormal cells.</li>
    <li>Curettage and desiccation: The lesion is scraped off (curettage) and then cauterized (desiccation) to remove the affected tissue.</li>
    <li>Cryotherapy: Freezing with liquid nitrogen to destroy the abnormal cells.</li>
    <li>Laser therapy: Laser beams are used to remove the cancerous cells.</li>
</ul>
      </p>
    </section>

      <h2 style="color:#3d09f6 ; font-family:verdana;">Diagnostic</h2>
      <p>
        A dermatologist can diagnose actinic keratoses through a visual examination of the skin. In some cases, a skin biopsy may be performed to confirm the diagnosis, particularly if there is uncertainty about the lesion's nature or if it does not respond to initial treatments.
        </p>
      <p>
        Diagnosis of intraepithelial carcinoma is made through a combination of clinical examination and skin biopsy. The biopsy involves removing a small sample of the affected skin for microscopic examination by a pathologist, confirming the presence of cancerous cells within the epidermis.
      </p>
      <p>
        Remember, both actinic keratoses and intraepithelial carcinoma are related to chronic sun exposure, so prevention through sun-protective measures, such as wearing sunscreen, protective clothing, and seeking shade during peak sun hours, is essential to reduce the risk of developing these skin conditions.
