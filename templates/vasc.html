    <h1>PYOGENIC GRANULOMAS AND HEMORRHAGE DETECTED</h1>
  </header>

  <main>
    <p>
        Pyogenic granulomas, also known as lobular capillary hemangiomas, are common benign skin growths that appear as small, reddish bumps on the skin or mucous membranes. They are not true granulomas but rather rapidly growing vascular lesions. Despite their name, pyogenic granulomas are not caused by infection and do not contain pus. They are often associated with minor skin injuries, hormonal changes during pregnancy, or as a response to certain medications.

      <h2 style="color:#3d09f6; font-family:verdana;">Basic Treatement</h2>
      <p>
        Treatment of pyogenic granulomas involves various methods depending on the size, location, and individual characteristics of the lesion. Some common treatment options include:
<ul>
    <li>Cryotherapy: Freezing the lesions with liquid nitrogen.</li>
    <li> Excision: Surgical removal of the pyogenic granuloma with a scalpel or other surgical tools. This method ensures complete removal and is typically used for larger lesions or those in sensitive areas.</li>
    <li>Laser therapy: Laser beams can be used to target and destroy the blood vessels in the pyogenic granuloma, leading to its removal.</li>
    <li>Electrocautery: The use of an electrical current to burn and destroy the lesion. This is often used for smaller lesions and can help control bleeding during the procedure.</li>
</ul>
      </p>

      <h2 style="color:#3d09f6 ; font-family:verdana;">Diagnostic</h2>
      <p>
        Diagnosing pyogenic granulomas is primarily based on their appearance and location on the skin. A healthcare professional, usually a dermatologist, can diagnose pyogenic granulomas through visual examination. In some cases, a skin biopsy may be performed to confirm the diagnosis or rule out other conditions.

        During a skin biopsy, a small sample of the lesion is removed and examined under a microscope by a pathologist to ensure that it is a benign pyogenic granuloma and not a more serious skin condition.
        </p>
        <p>
            For hemorrhage, the diagnosis is often evident based on the presence of bleeding and its underlying cause. Treatment for hemorrhage depends on the severity and location of the bleeding and may involve applying pressure, using hemostatic agents, or other interventions, depending on the situation.
        </p>
      <p>
        As with any skin concerns or bleeding issues, it is essential to seek medical evaluation from a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and appropriate treatment.
